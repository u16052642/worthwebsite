# WORTH Cloud Engineer Tech Test

Welcome! We need you! Help us deliver a static site based on the source code available
here ðŸš€
You may use any cloud provider of your choosing, however, you must use Terraform to define
your infrastructure.
Please store your project inside a public Git repository and submit a link to it as your
response.
Please deliver the product to the best of your ability, as if you were working on a project for
us & with the goal of handing it over to us before your technical interview.
Hereâ€™s some more details of what we need:
- The site should be served to the public.
- Two marketing users Alice & Malory should have access to only add to the /news
section
- Bobby the content editor needs to be able to edit the entire website.
- Charlie works in HR and should be able to update /people.html
- Add a custom error document.
- Automation of testing & deployment of infrastructure.
Remember there are no time limits: you will receive extra merit for showcasing your abilities
and we donâ€™t necessarily expect you to complete all these tasks. Weâ€™re interested in your
approach and the design choices you make.
Submit your code in a public Git repository.
GLHF ðŸ¤™
